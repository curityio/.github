# Topic Guidelines

## Code Examples

I have used the following default tags, in addition to `code-example`.\
I think the use of `oauth2` and `openid-connect` makes sense, since responsibilities are being implemented:

| Type | Default Tags |
| ---- | ------------ |
| API | api, oauth2, jwt-validation, scopes, claims, zero-trust |
| SPA | spa, oauth2, openid-connect |
| Website | website, oauth2, openid-connect |
| Mobile App | mobile, oauth2, openid-connect |

## Plugins

These use the tag `plugin` and also a type tag such as `authentication-action`.\
Topics such as these should be removed from plugins I think.\
Plugins are used within the context of an OAuth2 flow, but I would be more specific:

- curity
- login (for authenticators)
- oauth
- oauth2
