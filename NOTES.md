# Proposed Guidelines for Setting Tags

This suggests some guidelines for tags in public GitHub repos.\
The goal is to make the overall set of public repos coherent and consistent.

## Code Examples

All code examples use the `code-example` tag so that they can be found together.\
I have added these tags to each repo:

| Type | Default Tags |
| ---- | ------------ |
| API | api, jwt-validation, ascopes, claims, zero-trust |
| SPA | spa, |
| Website | website |
| Mobile App | mobile, |

## Programming Languages

These should be derivable from the contents of the repo, and not set in tags.

## Technology Stacks
